# Language-Detection-System-MILD-ML-
This project was designed to solve the problem of identifying spoken language in real-time by combining machine learning techniques and an intuitive frontend. A custom dataset was created to train the models, resulting in a 50% accuracy improvement over standard datasets. The final system compares multiple models to select the best-performing one.
